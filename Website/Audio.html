    <p>Song name: Sunday Morning</p>
    <p>Artist: TVM KILLA</p>
 <p>Lyrics:</p>
	<p>I said that love is like a maze and my heart is just the start of it.</p>
	<p>God just dealt the cards and finally upgraded my starter kit</p>
	<p>Heart inside the music like kit</p>
	<p>Who heart beatin as hard as this</p>
	<p>Exodus like Pharaoh’s, </p>
	<p>even James couldn’t harden this.</p>
	<p>Moses part the wave which had exposed my sea of doubt </p>
	<p>I Think my heart is in the west though my home is in the south </p>
	<p>I don’t snooze</p>
	<p>That’s why you know I’ll never lose</p>
	<p>Anyone that hates you</p>
	<p>Can catch the fade while they get these hands too</p>



<p> I got this song from my friend Aaron (TVM KILLA). He wrote and mixed the song himself. I recorded the vocals on Garage band. After recording the vocals, I aligned the instrumental with the vocals. I then exported them from garage band in a wav format. Next I imported and saved the audio and vocals as an mp3 on Audacity.</p>



<p>Their is a significant difference in size and quality. The file size effects the quality of the song. The smaller the size of the file, the more the quality of the audio will decrease.</p>
