<h3> Why I Chose Griz!!! </h3>
 
<p>Griz is also known as Grant Kwiecinski is one of my favorite Artists. I am not only in love with his music but what he does for the community. His goal is to Show Love and Spread Love. Griz even started an organization called the Liberators. The community of Griz lovers itself is called Griz fam. It started as a movement to connect with one another through music, pictures, and other associated art. The Liberators get together to help organize events and volunteer their time before shows helping with many charitable organizations across the country.</p>
<p>Griz is also a huge role model for a lot of people in the LGBTQ community. Griz came out as gay after struggling with his identity for years. After coming out he shared his story with fans and created an environment for other LGBTQ people to feel safe and could share their story. His music portrays how to stay positive and that everything will be ok. He does the same for people who suffer mental illness. He shares his story saying it is ok, that you will get better, and that we are here for you.</p>
<p>I have met Griz a few times myself. A lot of people say they should not meet their idol, but in this case, I was happy I did. He was so sweet; he gave me a hug and the biggest smile I had ever seen. He acts like he is a normal person that he is not better than us. I have seen him perform seven times this year. To me, Griz is my safe space. His music helps me get through my roughest times of battling depression and anxiety. I recommend people to listen to his music because of all the positivity, but also his music is never the same. You never know what he is going to play next.</p>
